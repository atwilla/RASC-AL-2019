# Summary

The RASC-AL competition is one in which universities across the USA are selected to 
compete against one another to construct a device capable of boring through simulated 
martian and lunar surfaces, melting ice beneath, and extracting and filtering the 
resultant water. The code in this repository will be used to control all sensors and 
most of the components that UTK's device will use through an arduino board. On top of 
this, a GUI will be written in Python to facilitate controlling and monitoring the 
device.

# Sensors to be Used

	1. ACS172 Current Sensor
	2. Force Sensors

# Components Controlled

	1. 2 Stepper motors for transverse motion
	2. Stepper motor for vertical motion
	3. Two linear actuators
	4. Heating element
	5. Peristaltic pump

# Dependencies

	1. Arduino IDE
	2. Arduino Board * 2
	3. Python >= 3
	4. Tkinter
	5. Pyserial library
