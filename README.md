#Summary

The RASC-AL competition is one in which universities across the USA are selected to 
compete against one another to construct a device capable of boring through simulated 
martian and lunar surfaces, melting ice beneath, and extracting and filtering the 
resultant water. The code in this repository will be used to control all sensors and 
most of the motors that UTK's device will use.
